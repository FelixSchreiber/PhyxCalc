== Introduction
PhyxCalc introduces a very flexible and comfortable way to calculate mathematical expressions, including physical units and complex numbers, using a flexible text-editor-like environment. In your expressions you can use a predefined selection of common constants and units or defining your own. You can even export your calculated formulas to OpenOffice Math formula editor to include them your everyday documents (support for LaTeX export is planned).

However please consider following rules:

* equivocal expressions (e.g. unit m and variable m) can cause problems, so try to avoid them

== Editor
In the main text edit expressions are both written and calculated. Just enter your expression and press return (or enter on mobile platforms) and the result will be written in the next line. The line will be replaced if it start with an equal sign. Not every result will be shown in the next line, some expressions like variable definitions have no output in the text edit. Inserting symbols and expressions is also possible with various docks, adding your own costomized dock is also possible and will be shown later.

*Example:* approximate formula for pi
----
3*ln(640320)/sqrt(163) <Return>
=3.141592653589793016
----

=== Comments
PhyxCalc understands following comment types: +
*//*    single line comment +
/* */ multi line comment

*Example:*
----
x=2 // a single line comment
x++ /* a very long comment
that would not fit in one line */
----

=== Keyboard shortcuts

*Text Editor shortcuts:* +

<Shift + Enter>:	Insert line break +
<Ctrl + Enter>:		Calculate expression, cursor stays at line +
<Ctrl + Z>:		Undo +
<Ctrl + Shift + Z>:	Redo +
<Ctrl + X>:		Cut +

<Ctrl + T>:		Open new tab +
<Ctrl + R>:		Recalculate whole document +
<Ctrl + Shift + R>:	Calculate from line +
<Ctrl + E>:		Open export dialog +
<Ctrl + Q>:		Quit application +

=== Exporting formulas
To export formulas use the export dialog. Once the dialog is opened, your expressions will be instantly converted. The converted output just insert in your OpenOffice Math.

=== Editing startup definitions
PhyxCalc loads a lot of predefined units and constants on startup. You can edit these definitions quite easy: just edit the file */settings/definitions.txt* +
*NOTE:* if you want to restore the default definitions, delete the defintions file and restart PhyxCalc

=== Adding your own docks
Adding your own customized docks to PhyxCalc is really simple. Just create a textfile with following outline in your setting directory:
----
tooltip; name in the dock; text to insert in the text editor
----

*Example:*
----
sine function;sin;sin()
cosine function;cos;cos()
tangens function;tan;tan()
arcus sine function;asin;asin()
arcus cosine function;acos;acos()
----

Then open the file docks.txt and add a line with the following outline:
----
docktitle;yourdockfilename.txt
----

*Example:*
----
Symbols;symbols.txt
----

Now restart PhyxCalc and start using your dock.

== Mathematical Functions
All mathematical functions can be written with the first letter uppercase or lowercase or only with uppercase letters. Trigonometric are using radiant, for degrees use dimensionless unit °.

=== Operators and symbols
PhyxCalc uses C++-like operators and some additional operators for special mathematical functionality. The operators are ordered beginning with highest priority.

*bcd* binary coded decimal function, converts a binary decimal coded number back to a dezimal value +
*tobcd* inverse of the bcd function

=== Defining custom functions
Defing custom functions in PhyxCalc is pretty easy, just write the name of your function, add the parameters and an expression.

*Example:* calculating a the current at a diode around the forward voltage
----
Is=10e-15A
VT=25mV
I(U)=Is*(exp(U/VT)-1)

I(0.6V)
=264.8912213µA
I(0.7V)
=14.46257064mA
I(0.8V)
=789.6296018mA
----

=== Precision
PhyxCalc is using 64bit and 96bit floating point numbers, depending on your operating system. As every computing system not using arbitrary precision, PhyxCalc has accuracy problems. Depending on your expression, this can cause your result to be not as accurate as you wish. See Wikipedia for more information on floating point numbers and accuracy problems: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Accuracy_problems

== List-Addition
To calculate a long list of numbers you can add a binary operator on the end of the first line. The result of this and the following lines will not be output but instead calculated togheter. You can view the current result in the variable dock. An empty line outputs the result.

The list mode can also be used to split an expression into multiple lines, but keep in mind that every line will be calculated as single term, maybe ignoring operator predence.

*Example: addition*
----
12+ <Return>
4 <Return>
3 <Return>
5 <Return>
<Return>
=24
----

*Example: multiplication*
----
2* <Return>
2+3 <Return>
<Return>
=10  // 2*(2+3) and not 2*2+3
----

== Variables and Constants
Variables could be used to save values in memory and as parameters for expressions. There is also a dock, where you can view all currently set variables.

*Defining variables and constants:* +
<variable name> = <expression> +
<constant name> := <expression> +
*NOTE:* only the result of the expression will be saved in the variable, to save the whole expression use functions

*Deleting variables and constants:* +
<variable name> = +
<constant name> := +

*Using variables and constants:* +
<variable name> +
<constant name>_ +

*Example:*
----
x=2 //defining variable x
c0:=299792458m/s //defining c0, speed of light in vacuum

x*c0_
=5.99585e+08m/s

x= //deleting variable x
c0:= //deleting constant c0
----

The *variable #* is a bit special. Everytime a value is output, the variable # is automatically set to this value, however, this variable can also be used like every other variable. +
You can also use the *ans function* instead of the # variable.

*Example:*
----
5+4
=9
#+sqr(#)  //# is like the ans (answer) button on some pocket calculators
=12
----

== Number formats and systems
You can insert numbers in decimal, hexadecimal, octal, binary or scientific format. You can also input complex numbers using the imaginary unit i or j. By default the ouput is automatically shown as integer, floating point number or in scientific format. PhyxCalc uses 19-20 digits precision, depending on the platform you use, however, the ouput precision is set to 6 by default, you can alter this setting in the settings dialog.

Using the \-> operator numbers can also be output in hexadecimal, octal or binary format. However, this is only implemented for positive integers.

*Example:*
----
//different number formats
(10 + 1.1) * 2E-10 / 4e2 + 0xFFAF - 0b10101001 * 0o345
=26754

//using complex numbers
(2j+34)*(23.2+4.5i)
=779.8+199.4i

//differnt number conversions
23->hex //converting decimal to hexadecimal
=0x17
10->bin //converting decimal to binary
=0b00001010
34->oct //converting decimal to octal
=0o42
0xF0->bin //converting hexadecimal to binary
=0b11110000
